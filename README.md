# ðŸ§  Detecting AI-Generated Product Reviews in Dravidian Languages (NAACL 2025 Shared Task)

## ðŸ“Œ Overview
This project was developed as part of the **Shared Task on Detecting AI-Generated Product Reviews in Dravidian Languages** at **DravidianLangTech@NAACL 2025**. The task focused on identifying automatically generated product reviews in **Malayalam** and **Tamil**, addressing the rising concern over AI-generated content in e-commerce and online platforms.

With the increasing sophistication of AI tools like ChatGPT and other LLMs, distinguishing between **human-written** and **machine-generated** reviews has become critical. This project explores **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** techniques tailored to the linguistic intricacies of **Dravidian languages** to detect AI-generated content reliably.

## ðŸŽ¯ Objective
Develop machine learning models to:
- Detect AI-generated product reviews in **Tamil** and **Malayalam**.
- Address language-specific challenges such as morphological richness and low-resource constraints.
- Improve authenticity verification in online reviews.

## ðŸ§° Tech Stack
- **Programming Language:** Python  
- **NLP Models:** BERT, IndicBERT, XLM-R  
- **Libraries:** HuggingFace Transformers, TensorFlow, Scikit-learn  
- **Tools:** Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- **Preprocessing:** Indic NLP Library, tokenization, transliteration support
